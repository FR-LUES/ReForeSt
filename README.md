## Introduction          
The aim of this DEFRA funded project is to link LiDAR derived structural metrics to forest biodiversity and in turn use LiDAR to explore how management interventions can enhance forest structure. The project is led by Forest Research (FR) in collaboration with the Environment Agency (EA) and the Sylva foundation. The LiDAR data used by the project was collected by the EAs England national LiDAR programme (NLP), as such all study sites are limited to England. The project comprises three seperate work packages (WPs): the first explores how LiDAR derived forest structure metrics can supplement/enhance/replace field derived metrics when explaining patterns of biodiversity, these metrics are then scaled to the national level; the second looks at LiDAR derived structural metrics through time as forests undergo different management interventions; and the third pilots the use of synthetic canopy height models (sCHMs), derived from aerial imagery, for measuring forest structural attributes. These three work packages are labelled WP3-WP5 as this is part of a wider project, not all of which is included in this repo. Below we described each work package in detail and we also link to more in depth descriptions of the code. General information about our code structure is provided in Box 1.

> **_BOX 1: Code structure_**
Each work package has its own set of scripts and these can all be found in the code folder. However, inputs and outputs for these scripts are stored together as they may overlap between work packages. We use a standard scripting pipeline for each work package where scripts 0 and 1 are setup and function scripts respectively. The setup script defines things like constants and file paths where the function script defines...functions. These two scripts MUST be run first for any of the following worker scripts to work. The worker scripts are also numbered and generally should be run sequentially, however you may be able to get away with running scripts in isolation as long as the setup and function scripts have been run.

### Linking LiDAR to biodiversity
Here, we collate biodiversity surveys from past Forest Research projects into a larger database. The back-bone of these data is the [WrEN project](https://www.wren-project.com/) which surveyed ~ 100 broadleaved forests across England and Scotland for a range of taxanomic groups. However this project could only use the English WrEN data as this is what the NLP is limited to, as such the WrEN data are supplemented by other similar projects to increase sample sizes. All surveys included field-based structural measurements which were subsequently shown to explain variation in biodiversity. We focus on three taxanomic groups as these were well surveyed across all study sites: understory plants, ground-crawling invertebrates (spiders and beetles), and flying invertebrates (hoverflies and craneflies). 

Our testing framework builds on past work from the WrEN project which identified the field-derived structural metrics that impact different taxanomic groups -  a small part of the wider WrEN project. For each biodiversity response we construct three models: one with field-derived structural metrics, one with LiDAR derived structural metrics, and one with both. We then use Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to select the best model. If LiDAR only models are equally as good as models with field-derived metrics then the LiDAR only models are chosen. For understory plants our responses are total species richness, the species richness of woodland associated ground flora, and the species richness of woodland specialist ground flora. For ground crawling and flying invertebrates our responses are species richness, the effective number of species (hill number q = 1), and abundance. 

The LiDAR metrics we extract are Foliage Height diversity (FHD) defined as the effective number of foliage layers, gap fraction (the proportion of a forest comprised of canopy gaps), and stem density. For the FHD metric our layers are defined as 0-1-2-5-8-20 meters. For the gap fraction metric, gaps are defined as any 10 m contiguous area where the foliage is below 2 m in height. FHD is calculated after removing gaps from each forest so as to make the metrics fully independent.

### Scaling up LiDAR metrics
We take LiDAR derived metrics found to be important in the above work area and process them across the entire NLP catalog (covering the whole of England). To do this we use the las catalog processing engine provided by the lidR R package. LAS catalogs are reference R objects which point to a collection of las or laz files. The catalog_map function allows us to process these wall to wall and save tiled outputs to file. This framework only reads in point cloud data currently being processed (with a small buffer to avoid edge effects), it then removes this data once processed to free up memory. Our outputs were rasters where each cell represents a structural diversity metric. The NLP took place over multiple years with some overlaps, as such we process each year individually as overlapping areas can bias results by changing point densities. These overlaps will be resolved in the resulting rasters by masking out previous years if more recent years are available.

### Comparing sCHMs and LiDAR CHMs
Seperate to this project, synthetic Canopy Height Models (sCHMs) are being produced for England by training aerial imagery on LiDAR derived CHMs. Results are promising and this gives us the opportunity to derive higher order structural metrics from these sCHMs which can be updated on a yearly basis. This will be useful for tracking structural diversity through time which can not be done with the NLP. Of course, these sCHMs cannot give any sub-canopy information and so they can only be used for tracking top canopy metrics such as gap fraction and the diversity of top canopy height. 

In WP4 we compare how sCHM derived metrics compare to LiDAR derived metrics. We were provided with around 30 tiles of sCHMs across England. We clip these to wooded NFI areas and extract gap fraction metrics and top canopy diversity metrics. We do the same for the corresponding LiDAR derived CHMs and compare the outputs.
